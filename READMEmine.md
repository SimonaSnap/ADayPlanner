# ADayPlanner

GitHub Deployed Page:

Description:

A Work Day planner
 - Up top is the date, and also the day of the week
 - there is a table with a row for each hour of the work day (set from 9 - 6)
 - each row has the hour, a task section and a save button
 - the task section will change color according to the day (gray = past, red = present, green = future)
 - the user can select a task section to input a task, then click the save button to store that task
 - at the end of the day, when currentHour = 24, storage is cleared and ready for the new day
